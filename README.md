*Open Science*

My open lab notebook ([https://github.com/benberman1/BenBerman_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab-..git]) contains important information and analyses related to my work on coral reef bioremediation carried out through the [Mass Lab](https://sites.google.com/marsci.haifa.ac.il/masslab/home?authuser=0/) (Coral Biomineralization and Physiology).
This notebook is platformed on GitHub and it is directly linked to GitHub repositories that contain further details presented in notebook posts.
