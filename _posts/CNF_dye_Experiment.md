##Using the CNF Polymer with Fluorecent Dye to See Incorperation into Coral Tissue

###Introduction
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are a polymer that uniquely integrates within the tissues of coral reefs, and when acompanied with a fluorecent dye, this incorperation can be visualized. This system provides a novel approach for tracking the successful delivery and incorperation of compounds into corals. 

###Methods
Small fragments of corals, in this case 4 from (_species_) , no larger than 0.5 cm were cut from a environmentally controlled laboratory aquarium hosting experimental coral subjects. These fragments were then glued with _ , cut side down, onto a 6-well glass plate and covered with _ sea water. Out of the 4 fragments, 1 was treated with just 100 ul of the CNF polymer, 1 was treated with 100 ul of the CNF polymer and fluorecent dye, and the remaining 2 were left untreated as controls. These were then imaged under a _ microscope and analyzed.

###Results
Successful incorperation of the CNF into coral tissues was observed through the fluorecence of the fluorecent dye under the microscope. Specific fluorecence lenses were applied to analyze the effect of the dye fluorecence under different wavelength colours. In each case, fluorence was present within the coral polyp.

###Discussion
The indication of successful polymer incorperation provides hope that this mechanism can be used to accurately and efficiently monitor the incorperation of substances and molecules, bound to the polymer, into coral and tracked using the fluorecent dye. 

However, significant damage was observed between the coral fragments that were treated versus the controls, with many of the coral polyps in the CNF+dye treatment being retreated compared to only few in the CNF treatment, where no polyps were harmed in the controls. This suggests that the concentration of dye applied was harmful to the coral, either initially or following fluorescence exposure, by chemical reactions. Thus, less dye should be used in the following analysis.
